# Tip Calculator
A simple iOS app that can calculate a tip for you ***and*** offers you the option to get a real-life tip

## Overview
This repository has the files for an iOS app (written in Swift) that will calculate your tip for you at the end of a wonderful meal. Not at a restaurant but still in need of a tip? If you're connected to the internet, then there's a special button to get a tip in the form of an inspiring quote (an API call is made and the information processed).
The app was created for an advacned programming concepts course, so the files are named accordingly.
